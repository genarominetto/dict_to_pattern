# Dict to Pattern

This is a scaffolding tool to create complete python template programs with tests from simple dictionaries. They are based on design patterns from the book **"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software."** The end in mind is to create a scaffolder for each design pattern in the book.
